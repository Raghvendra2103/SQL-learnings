(to create table)

create table customers
(
customer_id int,
first_name varchar(255),
last_name varchar(255),
email_address varchar(255),
number_of_complaints int,
primary key (customer_id),
unique key (email_address)
);


drop table customers;

(UNIQUE KEY)
alter table customers
add unique key (email_address);

(to drop unique key)
alter table customers
drop index email_address;

(gender)

alter table customers
add column gender enum('M','F') after last_name;

(values)
insert into customers(first_name, last_name, gender, email_address, number_of_complaints)
values('john', 'mackinley', 'M', 'john.mckinley@365carrers.com', 0);

(editing default constraints)
alter table customers
change column number_of_complaints number_of_complaints int default 0;

alter table customers
alter column number_of_complaints drop default;

(default constraint exercise solution)

create table companies
(
company_id varchar(255),
company_name varchar(255) default 'X',
headquaters_phone_number varchar(255),
primary key(company_id),
unique key(headquaters_phone_number)
);

(not null constraints)

drop table companies

create table companies
(
company_id int auto_increment,
headquaters_phone_number varchar(255),
company_name varchar(255) not null,
primary key (company_id)
);

alter table companies 
modify company_name varchar(255) null;

alter table companies
change column company_name company_name varchar(255) not null;

insert into companies (headquaters_phone_number, company_name)
values('+91 8770703994', 'company A')
;

select* from companies;

(not null exercises)

alter table companies
modify headquaters_phone_number varchar(255) null;

alter table companies
change column headquaters_phone_number 
headquaters_phone_number varchar(255) not null;
